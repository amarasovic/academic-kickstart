# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Modal sense classification (MSC) is a special WSD task that depends on the meaning of the proposition in the modal's scope. We explore a CNN architecture for classifying modal sense in English and German. We show that CNNs are superior to manually designed feature-based classifiers and a standard NN classifier. We analyze the feature maps learned by the CNN and identify known and previously unattested linguistic features. We benchmark the CNN on a standard WSD task, where it compares favorably to models using sense-disambiguated target vectors."
