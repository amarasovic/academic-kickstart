I am a postdoc at the [Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) / [AllenNLP Team](https://allennlp.org). I am interested in models that provide readable and faithful explanations of their classification decisions—focusing for now on [visual commonsense reasoning](https://visualcommonsense.com/). For my PhD thesis, I have studied deep learning for NLP tasks with limited labeled data such as [fine-grained opinion analysis](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1054/) and [anaphora resolution beyond entity anaphora](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1021/).
