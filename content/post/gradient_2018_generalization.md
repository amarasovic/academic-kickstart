title = "NLPâ€™s generalization problem, and how researchers are tackling it"
description = "News media has recently been reporting that machines are performing as well as and even outperforming humans at reading a document and answering questions about it, at determining if a given statement semantically entails another given statement, and at translation. It may seem reasonable to conclude that if machines can do all of these tasks, then they must possess true language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, this is not at all true. Numerous recent studies show that state-of-the-art systems are, in fact, both brittle and spurious."
